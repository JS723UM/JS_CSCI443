The questions asked here on an exam would be computed on small datasets as are used for question 31 in Part 7 and all the problems in Parts 8 and 9.  I recommend that you answer the questions in these sections without using Python or a calculator.

    "## Part 3: Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A *random variable* is a mapping of outcomes to the real line.  If we are given categorical data, it is useful to assign a numeric ordering so that we can do things like plotting a probability mass function where the x-axis spans the values the random variable can take.  For example, we could assign the numbers 1 through 12 for the ordinal categorical data of January through December.  For numeric data, the assignemnt is more straightforward, if the sample space of a random experiment is the numbers 1 through 4 then the randome variable maps the outcome 1 to 1 on the real line, 2 to 2 on the real line, 3 to 3 on the real line, and 4 to 4 on the real line.  When the data is numeric, it is customary to just state that the random variable takes on the value of the outcomes, e.g., we might say, \"let $X$ be the random variable denoting the value of a roll of a 6-sided die.\"  The outcomes are numeric so it is understood that the outcome 1 corresponds to the random variable $X$ taking on the value of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of random variables: *discrete* and *continuous*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of defective items in a delivery is a *discrete random variable*.  We typically use capital letters to denote a random variable.   For example we might say, \"let $X$ denote the random variable for the number of defective items in a delivery.\"\n",

    "The heights of students in a class is a *continuous random variable* as it can take on any positive real value in the real-line within what is possible for the heights of humans.  \n",

    "\n",
    "An *event* is a subset of the sample space.  When discussing random variables, an event is a subset of the values a random variable can take.  For example, names of children in a class may be a sample space.  We write each child's name on a slip of paper and place the slips in a hat.  The names are outcomes of the random expreiment of drawing a name from the hat.  Let $X$ denote the random variable that takes on the value of the name of a child.  If we are being pedantic, we would say that the random variable maps each name on to the real line; thereby, assigning a number for each child's name.  If these names include Alice, Bob, Charles, and Dan.  An example event for this sample space would be drawing either Bob or Charles (or pedantically stated, the numbers for Bob or Charles).    \n",

    "\n",
    "* The probability assigned to each outcome must be non-negative.\n",
